# Homelab Cloud & Enterprise Learning Roadmap

## Overview
This document serves as a roadmap and step-by-step guide for building a homelab environment that works both as a personal cloud and an enterprise learning playground.

---

## Stage 1 – Base Layer (Hypervisor Setup)
1. Install **Proxmox VE** on bare-metal server.
   - Download ISO: [Proxmox Downloads](https://www.proxmox.com/en/downloads)
   - Flash ISO to USB and boot server.
   - Configure static IP and access web UI: `https://<server-ip>:8006`
2. Configure storage pools (ZFS/LVM).
3. Update system:  
   ```bash
   apt update && apt dist-upgrade
   ```

---

## Stage 2 – Production VMs
### VM1 – aaPanel (Web Hosting)
- OS: Ubuntu 22.04 / Debian 11
- Install aaPanel to manage:
  - WordPress
  - Nextcloud
  - Ghost Blog

### VM2 – WireGuard VPN
- OS: Debian minimal
- Install WireGuard or use Docker + [wg-easy](https://github.com/wg-easy/wg-easy)
- Configure AllowedIPs for homelab LAN only.

### VM3 – Storage (Optional)
- Use **TrueNAS Core** or **OpenMediaVault** for network storage.

---

## Stage 3 – Lab VMs
### VM4 – Docker & Kubernetes
- Install Docker + Portainer.
- Deploy container apps:
  - GitLab CE
  - Jenkins
  - Ghost (test vs WordPress)
- Install MicroK8s / k3s for Kubernetes practice.

### VM5 – Monitoring
- Deploy Prometheus + Grafana.
- Install Node Exporter, cAdvisor, MySQL Exporter.

### VM6 – Security Lab
- Install Kali Linux.
- Deploy DVWA, Metasploitable.
- Install Wazuh SIEM for log analysis.

---

## Stage 4 – Networking
- Configure Proxmox bridges for **Production vs Lab VLANs**.
- Enforce VPN access via WireGuard before accessing apps.
- (Optional) Deploy pfSense VM for routing/firewall.

---

## Stage 5 – Automation
- Install **Ansible** for config automation.
- Use **Terraform** for infra provisioning.
- Setup **CI/CD** with Jenkins or GitLab CI for auto-deployment.

---

## Stage 6 – Expansion (Future-Proofing)
- Add additional server → form Proxmox Cluster.
- Enable High Availability (HA).
- Setup **Proxmox Backup Server** for snapshots and disaster recovery.

---

## Diagrams (to be added)
- Homelab Topology Diagram (Server → Proxmox → VMs → Apps)
- Network Flow (Laptop → VPN → Homelab LAN → Apps)

---

## Best Practices
- Keep Production and Lab isolated.
- Always use VPN for access.
- Schedule backups regularly.
- Use monitoring for resource tracking.
